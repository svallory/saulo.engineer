I did a few things I'm really proud of here. Starting with a free mentorship program I devised that brought
us a few excellent people, but more important than that, helped even more people become a coder and get a
job.

I created a new design process called Controlled Generative Design, and turned it into a product, from start
to finish. The product (CVA Figma plugin) uses AI to reduce the time of design component generation from
hours to only a few minutes.

I've also created a new language to reduce the time of specifying requirements for a UI that we use
internally. This UI DSL language (I called it Uisl) gave us a significant boost in performance.
