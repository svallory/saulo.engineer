It has been more than 20 years since I started developing software. There was a time when I was driven by a passion for coding. Something about the ability to create things out of words spoke to me, and I would be pretty happy just by seeing that there was a new thing in the world, a thing that I created!

Now, as a Senior Software Engineer and Chief Technology Officer at Toki Labs, I'm driven by the power of technology to transform lives and make a difference in the world. Code became a tool for transformation, as books were (and still are), and as AI is becoming. My drive, my passion, and my concern today is to use my time and skills wisely to make sure the changes I make are in fact positive.

<!-- Sometimes that's as simples and contributing to an open-source project, sometimes it means getting out of my desk to do something in the physical world.  I've contributed to several open-source projects like Storybook, Sass, Stylus, and Marko. But my favorite thing is to learn and help other people learn.

I'm always trying to optimize how I learn and that led me to launch a mentorship program for disadvantaged individuals, helping them become developers by teaching them how to learn. With over 50 mentees, I've witnessed the impact of teaching others to become self-learners and problem-solvers. Empowering people to unlock their potential has been a deeply rewarding experience. -->

I thrive in complexity. Instead of getting overwhelmed by combinatorial explosion of possibilities that come with any sufficiently complex system, I get excited with the opportunity to fit all the pieces together and find solutions where there seems to be none. I do that both for software and for social projects, and that's why I say that I'm a "Social Alchemist". I apply Game Theory to social issues, and I firmly believe that by understanding the motivations of individuals and groups, we can create positive-sum games that benefit everyone. This mindset has helped me solve problems and build strong relationships, both personally and professionally.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy exploring the complexities of life through poetry and music, reminding me of the importance of balance and interconnectedness. Ultimately, my diverse interests, experiences, and love for creating positive change shape who I am as a professional and a person. I am eager to continue leveraging technology, teaching, and creative thinking to transform at least a small part of the world and improve some lives.

So now you tell me: are you here to invite me for our next adventure?
