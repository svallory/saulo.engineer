# Marko JSON Schemas

## Contributing

## Updating the schemas

Schemas are written in Yaml under `src/` and then converted to json.

To edit the schemas and immediately test the changes, do the following:

1. Run `pnpm run dev`
2. Open the schema you want to edit
3. Open an example file from `tests/local/`
4. Edit & save the Yaml schema file
5. Trigger the autocomplete for the thing you want to check

## Validating the schemas

Most of the time you'll be able to see issues in vscode. But that's not always the case.

Before making a PR, be sure to run the `validate-examples` script

> Note: this is NOT perfect. Proper tests will eventually be written
> to ensure nothing breaks when updates are made to the schemas.

### Requirements to Run Validation

The validator is written in python and I recommend you install Python `>= 3.11`.

After python is set up, do the following:

1. Install `pipx`

   On a mac:

   ```shell
   brew install pipx
   pipx ensurepath

   # If you want to allow
   # pipx actions with --global argument:
   sudo pipx ensurepath --global
   ```

   Check [`pipx` docs](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file) for other systems.

   Enabling autocompletions for zsh:

   ```shell
   pipx install argcomplete
   # run the command below and follow the instructions
   pipx completions
   ```

2. Install `check-jsonschema`

   ```shell
   pipx install check-jsonschema
   ```

3. Validate the schemas

   From the repository root, run:

   ```shell
   ./validate-schemas.sh
   ```
