            We are a Software House that works differently. Instead of developing for clients, we seek and support
            partners. We are currently in private and are only taking new partnership projects via referral at the
            moment.

            Toki is a network of people helping each other realize their dreams. We are a horizontal organization with
            projects that range from art studios to mobile app development. My role in Toki is to devise the best
            strategies so people can reach their goals. I do that by finding out where dreams overlap so people walk
            toward their goal together and, in that process, their journey accelerates one another.

            At Truebill we were all senior developers, so when developing new features we took charge of the whole
            process from designing the architecture to monitoring it after it was deployed to the app. Among other
            features, I was responsible for the Pay Advance, which integrated our app with Synapse and Stripe to give
            customers instant pay advances and automatically charge it back when they got their paychecks.

            As a PCA I was responsible for coordinating the development and SaaS operations for several products. For
            most of the time I worked there, that product was http://getchute.com/

            The most challenging thing I did while there was coordinating a team of about 40 people to deliver deep
            changes to the product in one month, due to Facebook removing the Instagram API.

          <p>
            I helped bring the Doare architecture to a whole new level. We migrated from a Cake PHP application to a
            microservices based architecture on Node. Given the complexity of the business requirements, most of the
            services were built using Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS.
          </p>
          <p>Among other technologies, we used: node, typescript, angular, hapi</p>

          <p>
            I was hired to help Cleanify migrate the legacy monolithic PHP system to a microservices architecture on
            Node, using Hapi and written in Typescript. We also re-implemented UIs in React and Vue.js. A couple
            services required Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS, others were simple REST APIs and one was
            implemented using GraphQL. It was a lot of work but also really fun!

          <p>
            My first assignment at Sof.to was to define the entire development stack and strategy we would use. The
            result was a solid foundation which is used to solve very complex problems. It was based on Domain Driven
            Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing principles. We used C#.Net MVC and Web API on the backend; NHibernate and
            Entity Framework for persistence with a SQL Server database; Sass, TypeScript and Angular for the user
            interface.

          <p>
            I was hired to beat the challenge of single-handedly do in three weeks what the government had give a year
            for the companies to do: integrate the sales to a national database of electronic receipts. All went all and
            not even one sale was lost because we weren’t compliant with the new Brazilian law. The next big challenge
            was to change the entire development stack from a .Net 2.0 webpages setup to the current .Net 4.5 MVC 4
            following the Domain Driven Design. And do that without stopping the current demand for maintenance and new
            features. The benefit this change brought to company is hard to measure, but is certainly enormous in terms
            of productivity and developer happiness.
