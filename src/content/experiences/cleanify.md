I was hired to help Cleanify migrate the legacy monolithic PHP system to a microservices architecture on Node, using Hapi and written in Typescript. We also re-implemented UIs in React and Vue.js. A couple services required Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS, others were simple REST APIs and one was implemented using GraphQL. It was a lot of work but also really fun!
