I joined Rocket Money when it was still called Truebill. Back then, the company didn't have a well-defined onboarding process, so I decided to change that while I went through my own onboarding, so others wouldn't have to. I spearheaded a movement towards documentation, and managed to get not only IT, but all departments on board and excited about it. That's how Tuebill got its full-company wiki on Notion that we all came to depend on.

Developing at Truebill was a bit different. There, we took charge of a feature from architecture design, to deployment, and monitoring.

Among other features, I was responsible for the Pay Advance, which integrated our app with Synapse and Stripe to give customers instant pay advances and automatically charge it back when they got their paychecks.

My work on subscription management there was not like that, though. Subscriptions was a huge subsystem with old code nobody wanted to touch, but that was in desperate need of an update. That is actually where I shine the most: architecture. I can learn and understand a process really fast, and absorb a huge amount of information. On top of that, I actually have fun reorganizing, and optimizing complex systems. So I took it. The result was a more effective subscription management system that surpassed Stripe's and other tool's processes in reducing churn and in charge success rates.I joined Rocket Money when it was still called Truebill.
