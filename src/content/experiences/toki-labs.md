I accomplished a few things I'm really proud of here, aligning the company values with the development strategy. The low budget imposed a series of constraints that required a creative approach to staffing, development strategy and process optimization, and revenue increase.

• For staffing I Launched a mentorship program, attracting over 50 participants, leading to 5 full-time hires at low cost and facilitating 30+ to find a job in software development, reflecting our commitment to social impact.

• As a development strategy, I engineered Uisl, a proprietary UI specification language, optimizing our internal design to development workflow, resulting in at least a 50% reduction in specification time, compared to what I've seen in other software houses.

• To increase our revenue without outside investment, I expanded the idea of optimizing the UI development from Uisl to the Design Phase, via a subscription-based Figma plugin called CVA. The plugin encapsulates a new design process I've named "Controlled Generative Design". Using a rule-based semantic AI, the plugin reduces the time to create Design Systems by at least 70%, some tasks that used to take hours can be done in minutes.

Toki Labs now has a solid foundation with some happy clients like Calligo. And with these improvements in place, it is now on track for a profitable year in 2024.I accomplished a few things I'm really proud of here, aligning the company values with the development strategy.
