I was hired to beat the challenge of single-handedly do in three weeks what the government had give a year for the companies to do: integrate the sales to a national database of electronic receipts. All went all and not even one sale was lost because we weren't compliant with the new Brazilian law. The next big challenge was to change the entire development stack from a .Net 2.0 webpages setup to the current .Net 4.5 MVC 4 following the Domain Driven Design. And do that without stopping the current demand for maintenance and new features. The benefit this change brought to company is hard to measure, but is certainly enormous in terms of productivity and developer happiness.
