My first assignment at Sof.to was to define the entire development stack and strategy we would use. The result was a solid foundation which is used to solve very complex problems. It was based on Domain Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing principles. We used C#.Net MVC and Web API on the backend; NHibernate and Entity Framework for persistence with a SQL Server database; Sass, TypeScript and Angular for the user interface.
