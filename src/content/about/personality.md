### I thrive in complexity

Instead of getting overwhelmed by the combinatorial explosion of possibilities that comes with any sufficiently complex system, I get excited with the opportunity to fit all the pieces together and find solutions where there seems to be none.

I do that both for software and for social projects,
<br>and that's why I sometimes say that I'm a "Social Alchemist".

I apply Game Theory to social issues, and I firmly believe that by understanding the motivations of individuals and groups, we can create positive-sum games that benefit everyone. This mindset has helped me solve problems and build strong relationships, both personally and professionally.
