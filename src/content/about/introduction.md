There was a time when I was driven by a passion for coding. Something about the ability to create things out of words spoke to me. I would be pretty happy just to see that there was a new thing in the world, a thing that I created!

Now, as Chief Technology Officer at Toki Labs, I'm driven by the power of technology to transform lives, and make a difference in the world. Code became a tool for transformation, as AI is becoming now. My drive, my passion, and my concern today, is to use my time and skills wisely, and make sure the changes I make are in fact positive.
