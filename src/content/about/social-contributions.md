But my favorite thing is...

### To learn and help other people learn

I'm always trying to optimize how I learn and that led me to launch a mentorship program for disadvantaged individuals, helping them become developers by teaching them how to learn.

With over 50 mentees, I've witnessed the impact of teaching others to become self-learners and problem-solvers. Empowering people to unlock their potential has been a deeply rewarding experience.
