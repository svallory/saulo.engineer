### But life is more than work

In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy exploring the complexities of life through poetry and music.

Ultimately, my diverse interests, experiences, and love for creating positive change shape who I am as a professional and a person. I am eager to continue leveraging technology, teaching, and creative thinking to transform at least a small part of the world.
